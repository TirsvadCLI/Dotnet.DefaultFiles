## MSSQL Quality Criteria
- **Naming conventions**: Use PascalCase for naming tables, columns, procedures and other database objects (e.g., `CustomerOrder`, `GetCustomerById`).
    - Tables should be named in singular form (e.g., `Customer`, not `Customers`).
    - Database objects should use the prefix `usp` for stored procedures and `vw` for views.
    - All tables must have a primary key.

### Code Quality
- **dbo**: All objects should be contained in the `dbo` schema.
- **Indentation**: Use consistent indentation with 4 spaces per level.
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex queries or logic in SQL code.
