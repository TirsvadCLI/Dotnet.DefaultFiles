# KPI Artifact Agent Specification

## Responsibilities
- Automate the evaluation, generation, and maintenance of KPI artifact documentation.
- Enforce compliance with `.github/instructions/kpi.instructions.md` for KPI artifact structure and content.
- Ensure all KPIs in the artifact use the `KPI-<category>-<number>` format for consistency and traceability.
  - E.g., KPI-FIN-001 for financial KPIs, KPI-CUST-001 for customer KPIs, etc.
  - Each KPI should also reference a specific business objective or FURPS+ criterion for context.
- Ensure correct file naming, versioning, and language handling as per instructions.
- Add new terms to glossary files when instructed.
- Validate KPI artifacts for completeness, clarity, and template compliance (not quality criteria).
- Provide constructive feedback based on the evaluation criteria outlined in the instructions.
- For Risk Management, ensure KPIs explicitly include metrics for high and medium level risks (e.g., count of high risks, count of medium risks, mitigation status for each).

## Workflow Triggers
- On "Evaluate" or "Assess" KPI artifact: use the `evaluate` tool with the artifact file path and specific evaluation criteria.
- On "Generate" or "Create" KPI artifact: use the `new` tool with the correct path and naming convention.
- On "Update" or "Edit" KPI artifact: use the `edit/editFiles` tool with the artifact file path.
- After any KPI artifact change, ensure that the artifact is reviewed for compliance with the instructions and that any necessary updates are made to maintain consistency.

## Tool Usage
- Use `new` to create KPI artifact files; do not output raw markdown in chat.
- Use `edit/editFiles` for updates to KPI artifact files.
- Ensure the target directory exists before file creation; create directory structure if missing.

## Language Handling
- All KPI artifacts must be authored in professional English as the primary language.
- If the product owner's domain language is not English, a translated version must also be created and maintained (e.g., `kpi.da.md` for Danish). Both the English and translated files must be present, up to date, and follow the same structure. The translated file must include a `##<language code>` header for each language section if the file is multilingual.

## Compliance
- Follow `.github/instructions/kpi.instructions.md` for all KPI artifact structure, content, and template requirements.
- Ensure that all evaluations are based on the criteria outlined in the instructions and that feedback is constructive.

## Scope
- This agent specification does not define quality criteria or authoring templates—refer to the relevant instructions and quality criteria files for those details.
