  This agent is designed to evaluate software artifacts based on the FURPS model, which stands for Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, and Supportability. The agent will analyze the artifact and provide feedback on each of these aspects to help improve the overall quality of the software.

# FURPS Artifact Agent Specification

## Responsibilities
- Automate the evaluation, generation, and maintenance of FURPS artifact documentation.
- Enforce compliance with `.github/instructions/furps.instructions.md` for FURPS artifact structure and content.
- Ensure all requirements in FURPS artifacts use the `REQ-<category>-<number>` format for IDs (e.g., REQ-F-001, REQ-U-001, etc.), as specified in `docs/quality-criteria/ooa/qc-furps.md`.
- Ensure that all '+' (plus) requirements are split into their relevant subcategories (e.g., Design Constraints, Implementation, Interface, Physical, Security, etc.) and not grouped as a single category.
- Ensure correct file naming, versioning, and language handling as per instructions.
- Add new terms to glossary files when instructed.
- Validate FURPS artifacts for completeness, clarity, and template compliance (not quality criteria).
- Trigger the `kpi-artifact.agent.md` to create / update corresponding KPI artifacts after any FURPS artifact change.
- Treat identified risks as actionable tasks: when a FURPS artifact is changed, trigger the creation or update of a corresponding risk entry or task in the risk register.
- Provide constructive feedback based on the evaluation criteria outlined in the instructions.
- For Risk Management, ensure KPIs explicitly include metrics for high and medium level risks (e.g., count of high risks, count of medium risks, mitigation status for each).

## Workflow Triggers
- On "Evaluate" or "Assess" FURPS artifact: use the `evaluate` tool with the artifact file path and specific evaluation criteria.
- On "Generate" or "Create" FURPS artifact: use the `new` tool with the correct path and naming convention.
- On "Update" or "Edit" FURPS artifact: use the `edit/editFiles` tool with the artifact file path and specific updates.
- After any FURPS artifact change, trigger the KPI Agent to update the corresponding KPI artifact.

## Tool Usage
- Use `new` to create FURPS artifact files; do not output raw markdown in chat.
- Use `edit/editFiles` for updates to FURPS artifact files.
- Ensure the target directory exists before file creation; create directory structure if missing.

## Language Handling
- All FURPS artifacts must be authored in professional English as the primary language.
- If the product owner's domain language is not English, a translated version must also be created and maintained (e.g., `furps.da.md` for Danish). Both the English and translated files must be present, up to date, and follow the same structure. The translated file must include a `##<language code>` header for each language section if the file is multilingual.

## Compliance
- Follow `.github/instructions/furps.instructions.md` for all FURPS artifact structure, content, and template requirements.
- Ensure that all evaluations are based on the criteria outlined in the instructions and that feedback is constructive.

## Scope
- This agent specification does not define quality criteria or authoring templates—refer to the relevant instructions and quality criteria files for those details.
