# Use Case Instructions
This instruction file provides a template and authoring instructions for documenting Use Cases in markdown format.
Use this as a starting point for any project requiring use case documentation.
Replace all placeholders in the template with project-specific content.

## General Instructions
- Use this template for all use case documentation in markdown format.
- Always include casual and fully dressed use case sections for comprehensive documentation.
- Replace all bracketed placeholders in the template with project-specific information.
- Store use case files in the centralized repository under the `use-cases` folder and `uc-<use case identifier>-<descriptions>` subfolders (no spaces in names).
- The description should be used as the authoritative "Use Case Description" in the corresponding use case markdown file (e.g., `docs/use-cases/uc-006-Develop WebAPI endpoint for code coverage/uc-006.md`). The same approach should be applied for all other use cases, using the "Description" column from the table as the main description in each UC file.
- If product owner domain language is different from English, create a separate file for the diagram content in that language while maintaining English for metadata and versioning. Use a language code suffix in the file name , following the pattern: `uc-<use case identifier>.<language code>.md`). See Product Owner Domain Language in `docs/bc.md` for more details.
- Make or update Glossary entries for any new terms introduced in the use case documentation (e.g, "Painkiller", "Smertstillende" in Danish). Filename the glossary entry with the same language code suffix as the use case file (e.g., `docs/glossary.<language code>.md`).

## Best Practices
- Clearly define all required use case sections.
- Use clear, concise, and business-oriented language.
- Document all assumptions and dependencies.
- Ensure layout is consistent and easy to understand.
- Number each flow step (1, 2, 3, ...).
- Reference flow step numbers in exceptions (e.g., 1.a, 3.a) and provide a paragraph description for each exception.

## Code Standards
- Each use case must have a unique version identifier and a documented change log.
- Use the provided markdown template for consistency.

### File Naming
- Name files and folders without spaces, using digits for use case numbers, following the pattern: `uc-<use case identifier>.md` (e.g., `uc-003.md`).

## Common Patterns
### Good Example
```markdown
## Metadata
| Key               | Value                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Id                | UC-XXX                            |
| crossReference    | [Insert Cross Reference]<br>[Insert Cross Reference] |

## Version Log
| Version | Date       | Description              | Author     |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|------------|
| 0001    | [yyyy-mm-dd] | Initial                  | project owner |
```

## Maintenance  
- Update the version and change log for major changes.
- Regularly review use cases for accuracy and relevance.
- Review and approve use cases with relevant stakeholders before acceptance.
```

## Validation
- Review use cases for completeness, clarity, and correct use of the template.
- Verify that all placeholders are replaced with project-specific content.

## Language
- Active form
- Professional
- English
- If product owner domain language is different, use that language for the diagram content while maintaining English for metadata and versioning. And save the file with a language code suffix (e.g., `uc-xxx.da.md` for Danish). So now we have two files: `uc-xxx.md` (English) and `uc-xxx.da.md` (Danish).
