# Instructions (Summary)
- Use the provided markdown template / examples.
- Replace all placeholders with project-specific content.
- Store files in `docs/` as `furps.md`.
- FURPS artifacts must follow the structure and content guidelines outlined in this document.
- All requirements must use the `REQ-<category>-<number>` format for IDs (e.g., REQ-F-001, REQ-U-001, etc.).
- All '+' (plus) requirements must be categorized into relevant subcategories (e.g., Design Constraints, Implementation, Interface, Physical, Security, etc.) and not grouped as a single category.
- FURPS artifacts must be versioned and include a change log.
- FURPS artifacts must be authored in professional English, with translated versions maintained if the product owner's domain language is not English. if product owner domain language differs, create a separate file with language code suffix (e.g., `furps.da.md`) and include a translation section in the English file.
